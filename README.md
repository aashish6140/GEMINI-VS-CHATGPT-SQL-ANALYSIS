# GEMINI-VS-CHATGPT-SQL-ANALYSIS

Using SQL methodologies, we conducted a comparison analysis of Gemini and ChatGPT.
Merged and organized data from several tables using joins, group by, order by, and case statements.
I used window functions and subqueries to investigate trends and patterns in the dataset.
Calculated aggregate functions, such as sum, average, and count, are used to measure numerous performance metrics.
I used the where clause deliberately to filter data and optimize my findings.
Comprehensive SQL analysis provided useful insights into the strengths and shortcomings of both platforms.
